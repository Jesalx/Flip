Flip is a project aimed at helping users manage their library of books. It has a clean user interface, allows users to sort and filter their library with various conditions, and offers interesting insight into user reading history. Flip syncs user data across their devices and integrates with [Spotlight](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corespotlight) and provides widgets for keeping up with your reading goal at a glance. Flip's minimum requirements are iOS 16 and iPadOS 16.

Flip is built using the [Swift](https://www.swift.org) language, [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) for the UI, [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) + [Cloud Kit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit) for managing user data, the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) for fetching data related to user queries, and the [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers) for fetching covers when necessary.
