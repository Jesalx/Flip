# Flip

Flip is a project aimed at helping users manage their library of books. It has a clean user interface, allows users to sort and filter their library with various conditions, and offers interesting insight into user reading history. Flip syncs user data across their devices and integrates with [Spotlight](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corespotlight). Flip requires iOS 16 or newer.

Flip is built using the [Swift](https://www.swift.org) language, [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) for the UI, [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) + [Cloud Kit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit) for managing user data, and the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) for fetching data related to user queries.
